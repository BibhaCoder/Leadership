Leading = Leadership + Investing
=================================
- 👋 Hi, I’m @bibhacoder
- 👀 I’m interested in engineering leadership and in general very intriguing topic of leadership.
- We all are aware of basic human physiological needs (e.g. food, shelter, clothing, water, air, sleep etc.) but is it enough for a human to thrive?
- What are basic human psychological needs?
- I have coined a word **TEAMS** to describe 5 basic human psychological needs for humans across culture to thrive in any work environment:

-   **T: Teamwork** (All humans want to be part of a group or a team)
-   **E: Equality** (All humans want to be treated with equality and fairness)
-   **A: Appreciation** (All humans want to be appreciated, feel important and have significance in their life)
-   **M: Motivation** (All humans want to be motivated and motivation comes from freedom and growth)
-   **S: Stability** (All humans want stability of resources in their life)

 **Leadership excellence** is achieved when leaders are driven by following key values(Keyword **RISE**):

- **R: Resonant and Results Oriented**: Being resonant and focused on results.
- **I: Internally driven**: Being driven by our core internal values(**GRIT**).
- **S: Serving others**: Being able to serve and add values to others.
- **E: Embrace ideas**: Being open to external ideas.

To get best out of their team an effective leader does following(Keyword **ACT**):

- **A: Accountability**: Keeping everyone accountable for their actions in their team.
- **C: Challenge**: Challenges their team to stretch and do their best.
- **T: Talent**: Recognizes and attracts excellent talents and develop them.

True measure of leadership is measured by keyword **LIVE**:

- **L: Learn, improve and deliver continuously (LID infinite loop)**: True leaders learn continuously to improve and deliver results.
- **I: Influence emotionally**: True measure of leadership is positive emotional Influence.
- **V: Victory**: True leaders make their people victorious.
- **E: Empower**: True leaders Empower their people.

Excellence of leadership is achieved with **HER**


- **H: Humility**: Top level leaders are personally humble.
- **ER: Extreme Resolve**: Top level leaders have fierce resolve for their organizations.

We become leader when we **RISE**.

Positive change occurs when leaders **ACT**.

Leaders are measured by how they have **LIVE**.

Leaders respect their **TEAMS** to acheive excellence.

- **T**: **Teamwork(persuasion)** for a shared common vision
- **E**: **Empower** everyone to do their best work
- **A**: **Appreciate** to challenge everyone to exceed expectations

- **E: Efficacy**: Develop sense of efficacy to succeed as a team.
- **S: Support**: Support each other.

**Investors are AWARE to stay ALIVE to find LOGIC and develop GRIT to use AI when art of signal and science of safety both are in equilibrium**.

Investors are AWARE

- **A: Appreciativeness (Gratitude)**

**AAPIS** = **A**mbika **A**nalytics **P**owered **I**nvesting **S**trategy (**AAPIS**)(AKA **AI** = **A**ccelerated **I**ndexing).

**Core Strategic Principle: Low cost, solid performing and optimal risk based accelerated disciplined investing strategy to reduce equity ownership inequality and make the world a better place.**

Over the past century the U.S. equity market has provided the best CAGR for investors. The U.S. equity market has outperformed all other types of available investments over the past century but the ownership of the U.S. equities market is not very equal.

Few facts about equity ownership inequality in U.S. as of October 2024:
1) ~62% of US adults own equities.
2) ~1% of top wealthiest investors own ~50% of US equities.
3) ~10% of top wealthiest investors own ~93% of total US equities.
4) ~90% of bottom investors combined own only ~7% of US equities.

**AAPIS** provides systematic risk adjusted optimal passive benchmark accelerated index to periodically accelerate and positively boost your CAGR by increasing the exposure and ownership of US equities(e.g S&P 500) only when having higher exposure is rewarded handsomely by equities markets during long term low volatility conditions. **AAPIS** is designed to accelerate and positively boost the CAGR for retail investors who have limited amount of money to invest.

Please note that AAPIS is designed for tax deferred account (401k/IRA/HSA etc).

***Please note that for small retail investors the best way to own common equities is via an ultra low cost broad market index based ETF (e.g VGT, VUG, VOO, VTI etc).***
