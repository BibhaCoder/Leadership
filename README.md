Leadership
=================================
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bibharajeev
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in engineering leadership and in general very intriguing topic of leadership.
- We all are aware of basic human physiological needs (e.g. food, shelter, clothing, water, air, sleep etc.) but is it enough for a human to thrive?
- What are basic human psychological needs?
- I have coined a word **TEAMS** to describe 5 basic human psychological needs for humans across culture to thrive in any work environment:

-   **T: Teamwork** (All humans want to be part of a group or a team)
-   **E: Equality** (All humans want to be treated with equality and fairness)
-   **A: Appreciation** (All humans want to be appreciated, feel important and have significance in their life)
-   **M: Motivation** (All humans want to be motivated and motivation comes from freedom and growth)
-   **S: Stability** (All humans want stability of resources in their life)

 **Leadership excellence** is achieved when leaders are driven by following key values(Keyword **RISE**):

- **R: Resonant and Results Oriented**: Being resonant and focused on results.
- **I: Internally driven**: Being driven by our core internal values(**GRIT**).
- **S: Serving others**: Being able to serve and add values to others.
- **E: Embrace ideas**: Being open to external ideas.

To get best out of their team an effective leader does following(Keyword **ACT**):

- **A: Accountability**: Keeping everyone accountable for their actions in their team.
- **C: Challenge**: Challenges their team to stretch and do their best.
- **T: Talent**: Recognizes and attracts excellent talents and develop them.

True measure of leadership is measured by keyword **LIVE**:

- **L: Learn, improve and deliver continuously (LID infinite loop)**: True leaders learn continuously to improve and deliver results.
- **I: Influence emotionally**: True measure of leadership is positive emotional Influence.
- **V: Victory**: True leaders make their people victorious.
- **E: Empower**: True leaders Empower their people.

Top level of leadership is achieved with **HER**


- **H: Humility**: Top level leaders are personally humble.
- **ER: Extreme Resolve**: Top level leaders have fierce resolve for their organizations.

We become leader when we **RISE**.

Positive change occurs when leaders **ACT**.

Leaders are measured by how they have **LIVE**.

Leaders respect their **TEAMS** to acheive excellence.

- **E**: **Empower** everyone to do their best work
- **A**: **Appreciate** to challenge everyone to exceed expectations
